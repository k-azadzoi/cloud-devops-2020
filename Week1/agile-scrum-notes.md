# Agile/Scrum
---
## Waterfall
* Sometimes called traditional framework was generally a set of sequential steps.
* It required the majority of the work in each step to be completed BEFORE and of the next step could begin.
### Problems
* Assumes all requirements are known up front and nothing will change before the deployment of the application.
* Can take several months or even years from start to deployment even when the project goes as planned.
* If requirements change, the schedule can be significantly impacted, and it would be costly to the project.
* If testing uncovers design or requirements errors, the cost and schedule impacts can be crippling to the project.

*This approach has proven to be very expensive and delay prone.*

## Agile
### What is Agile?
> Agile software development describes an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.
### Manifesto
* Individuals and interactions > processes and tools
* Working software > comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration > contract negotiation
* Responding to change  > following a plan

## Scrum
### What is Scrum?
* It's a framework intended to be adaptable to the team's needs, not a methodology
* It's iterative, focused on a small deliverable features of the application
* It's aligned with the Agile principles
* It's self-managed by the team
* It's one of multiple Agile compliant frameworks
### Theory
> Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
### Three Pillars
* Transparency - significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
* Inspection - access to artifacts and progress reports
* Adaption - working smart for your team/products

## Roles of Scrums
> Scrum relies on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. The scrum team is self-organizing in that there is no overall team leader who decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be solved. Those are issues that are decided by the team, as a whole.

* Scrum Master - generally thought of as a coach for the team, helping team members use the scrum process to perform at the highest level. Facilities meetings and charged with removing roadblocks and addressing impediments for the team.
* Product Owner - Owns the product backlog, represents the business, " grooms" the user stories by prioritizing and writing acceptance criteria.
* Development Team - the coders, testers, and anyone else working the user stories, they are charged with doing 'whatever it takes' to get the work done.
	* Ad hoc members - Occasionally special skill sets may be needed, and outside experts may be brought in short term for a sprint.   They engage to complete a unit of work that team does not have the skillset to accomplish themselves.
	* Stakeholders - Everyone else that may have an interest in the development of the application.  They may attend the Sprint Reviews.

## The Artifacts of Scrum
* Product Backlog - List of epics and user stories waiting to be worked in future sprints
* Sprint Backlog - The user stories committed to be worked in a sprint
* Increment - The body of work accepted by by the product owner at the end of a sprint

## The Backlog Items of Scrum
* Epic - a big chunk of work that has one common objective. It could be a feature, customer request or business requirement. In the backlog, it is a placeholder for a required feature with few lines of description.
* User Story - captures a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. It describes the type of user, what they want and why.
* Task - Smaller work items used to break a story into smaller units.
