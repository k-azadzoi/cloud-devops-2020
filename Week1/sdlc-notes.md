# Software Development Life Cycle
---
## What is SDLC and how does it relate to software development?
> The Software Development Life Cycle is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimate. 

_In other words, the SDLC is there ensure maximum efficiency is being met when working on a complex product._ 

### Software Development Life Cycle - Phases
* Business Analysis/Requirement Gathering 
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance

**This is iterative. Hence, the CYCLE part of the name...**

## Requirements Analysis
### Stage 1A - Business Analysis
* This is the initial part of the requirements analysis phase and it answers the question - **Where are we now?**
	* We need to understand the current business process and practices, which would help us in determining the business needs.

### Stage 1B - Requirement Gathering
* Otherwise known as Requirements Analysis, when including Business Analysis phase, answers the question – **What are we building?** 
	* This is the phase where Business Analyst gather information from the customer that describes what they want and how they want it used.

**This is the MOST important stage of the SDLC. Every other phase is based on the requirements.**

### High-Level Document (HLD)
* The overall system design - covering the system architecture and database design. It describes the relation b/t various modules and functions of the system. Data flow, flow charts and data structures are covered under HLD.

### Low-Level Document (LLD)
* It defines the actual logic for each and every component of the system. Class diagrams with all the methods and relations come under LLD. Program specs are covered under LLD.  

## Design
###Stage 2 - Design
* Answers the question - **How we build it?**
	* This phase is key to the developer. The design is pieced together from the system analysis. There are various graphical designs used to illustrate the flow of the application. From a system perspective (security, notifications, business requirements, etc.) to a user perspective, all have flows to clear.


## Implementation
### Stage 3 - Implementation
* Answers the question - **Let's make it happen?**
	* Basically, the let's get coding stage.

## Testing
### Stage 4 - Testing
* Answers the question - **Is the software of good quality?**
	* Software quality is best determined by how well the software meets the requirements.
	* Fit-for-use is from a user perspective and defines whether product is useful for daily usage.
	
## Deployment
### Stage 5 - Deployment
* This stage is also referred to as the “Go Live” stage. It is now time to see if our business analyst and programmers have earned the big bucks, the company has paid for their services.

## Maintenance
### Stage 6 - Maintenance
* Maintenance is an ongoing process. There is no such thing as a completed application. There is always room for improvement, or something overlooked. The Maintenance phase refers to any upgrades, fixes or improvements to the application, after deployment.
